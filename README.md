# clippers_ios_app
postmates for haircuts


PROPOSAL:

Clippers is an application similar to postmates but for haircuts. This app will have a scrolling list of barbers which will come over and cut your hair. The list of barbers will be stored in a database along with their ratings, rates, reviews, and max distance to travel. The nearby tab which you will be greeted with will show all barbers whos max distance travel does not exceed that distance from the user. An account tab would also be useful in order to store user preferences. A previous orders tab could show previous haircuts ordered along with your rating and cost. Along with these must have features it would be nice, it time accomodates, to make an app for the 'clippers' themselves in order to input themselves into the same database which the users of the main app view. 

This is a descent feature set so I think implementation will take some time. My main time constraint, I believe, will be accessing a database.
TASKS:
UI (4 hours)
Database(1-2 hours)
App interaction with database(5-6 hours)
Barber Model (2-3 hours)
Previous Orders(1 hour)
Account Tab(2-3 hours)

POSSIBLE EXTRA: BARBER APP(6 hours)
